{"name":"Anonize","tagline":"A Cryptographically Anonymous Survey System","body":"### Anonize\r\nAnonize is a cryptographically anonymous survey system.  It allows anyone to select an ad-hoc group of users (based on their emails for example) and create a survey in which only those users can anonymously submit exactly one response.  In the past, either anonymous surveys have allowed dishonest users to submit multiple responses and skew the results, or they have required a _trusted third party_ to blind the identities of the respondents.   Additionally, in the past, the setup of such systems has been tedious work.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA secure ad-hoc survey scheme enables a survey authority to independently (without any interac- tion) select an ad-hoc group of registered users based only on their identities (e.g., their email addresses), and create a survey where only selected users can anonymously submit exactly one response. We present a formalization of secure ad-hoc surveys and a provably-secure implemen- tation in the random oracle model, called ANONIZE. Our performance analysis shows that ANONIZE enables securely implementing million-person anonymous surveys using a single modern workstation. As far as we know, ANONIZE constitutes the first implementation of a large-scale secure computation protocol (of non-trivial functionalities) that scales to millions of users.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was started by 4 professors of cryptography: Rafael Pass at Cornell, Susan Hohenberger at Johns Hopkins, Steven Myers at Indiana University, and abhi shelat at the U. of Virginia.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
